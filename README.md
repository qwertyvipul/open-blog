## What is open-blog?

This is probably one of the very first questions that would have popped up in your head when you first landed here.

Well, the story is simple: I had long been struggling to pick the best blogging platform for myself, but I needed something to click. I was looking for a solution where:
1. I can write in markdown
2. Engage with the community
3. Dedicated search feature, tagging, labeling, etc.

But I didn't want to:
1. Drive the engagement via a subscription model, but rather based on interest.
2. Make money or gain fame.

And I tried out:
1. Medium
2. Substack
3. write.as
4. Blogger
5. WordPress

But, hey, this is what clicked. open-blog is basically my blogging repository, and the [issues](https://github.com/qwertyvipul/open-blog/issues) are the blogs.
